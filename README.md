### [Day 1](Day-1)

> Reading data from `.csv` files using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) *Dataframes*, finding % of women who survived the Titanic and then using [RandomForestClassifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest), making a model to predict the survival of the female passengers using features like
>
> ```python
> features = ["Pclass", "Sex", "SibSp", "Parch"]
> ```
>
> ,and then restructuring the predicted values with the `PassengerIds` as a *DataFrame* and storing them in a `.csv` file for submission.
>
> This was just trying out some ML intoduction stuffs.

### [Day 2](Day-2)

> Just a practice notebook for Python3, testing out assignment operators, arithmetic operators, and performing basic arithmetic problems using Python3 to get a grasp of the language.

### [Day 3](Day-3)

> Advancing from the previous notebook, here I get to use some predefined and also custom functions and perform arithmetic operations but using functions and nested functions.

### [Day 4]()

> All about the Boolean data type, which allows you to represent “`True`” and “`False`” in Python code. This will provide a strong foundation for understanding how to write conditional statements, which are used to modify how code runs based on whether certain conditions hold.

### [Day 5](Day-5)

> Python lists to store ordered collections of values. Lists are incredibly useful when writing code to manage several related variables.
>
> Efficient way to repeatedly execute code. With list comprehensions, you'll often be able to condense code that would have taken several lines to just a single line!

### [Day 6](Day-6)

> Strings, which is a data type that is useful for representing human-readable data, such as text. A dictionary is another new data type, that is similar to a list, but with important differences that makes it incredibly useful in its own right.

### [Day 7](Day-7)

> One of the best things about Python is the vast number of high-quality custom libraries that have been written for it. Here, you can try out various other pre-written functions to use during various computation, like in this *[.ipnyb](Day-7\exercise-working-with-external-libraries.ipynb)* file.

### [Day 8](Day-8)

> You will start at the very beginning: what exactly is “Machine Learning”, and how is it used in the real world? You'll learn the answers to these questions and explore the basics of decision trees, as you start to build a strong foundation for some of the most cutting-edge techniques in data science.
>
> All about pandas, the primary tool used by data scientists for exploring and manipulating data. Then, you'll use your new knowledge to examine a dataset of home prices.

### [Day 9](Day-9)

> You'll create a machine learning model using the scikit-learn library, one of the most popular and efficient tools for data analysis.
>
> Along the way, you'll learn some basic techniques for working with very large datasets. These skills are especially important for modern data scientists, who often work with “*big data*” containing millions of variables ― many more than a human can conceivably understand! Thankfully, machines excel at discovering useful patterns in datasets that are too large for humans to wrap their heads around. :)
>
> Once you have built a model, how good is it? How exactly should you judge how close the model's predictions are to what actually happened? You'll use model validation to measure the quality of your model.

### [Day 10](Day-10)

> You'll learn about the fundamental concepts of underfitting and overfitting. Then you'll apply these ideas to gain a deep understanding of why some models succeed and others fail. This knowledge will make you much more efficient at discovering highly accurate machine learning models.
>
> You'll learn all about random forests, another machine learning model you can add to your growing toolkit. Then, put your new knowledge to use immediately by building your own random forest model that exceeds the performance of the models that you've built so far!

### [Day 11](Day-11)

> One way to further improve your skills is to participate in machine learning competitions.

### [Day 12](Day-12)

> Most machine learning libraries (including scikit-learn) give an error if you try to build a model using data with missing values. You'll learn about three different approaches for dealing with missing values in your data.
>
> A categorical variable is a variable that takes only a limited number of values, and it's common to encounter them in data. Learn how to work with them.

### [Day 13](Day-13)

> You'll learn a simple way to keep your data preprocessing and modeling code organized.
>
> You're already a bit familiar with model validation, so you''ll explore a more advanced validation technique that gives a better measure of model performance.

### Day 14
