# 30-Days-of-ML-Kaggle

### Day 1

> Reading data from `.csv` files using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) *Dataframes*, finding % of women who survived the Titanic and then using [RandomForestClassifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest), making a model to predict the survival of the female passengers using features like
>
> ```python
> features = ["Pclass", "Sex", "SibSp", "Parch"]
> ```
>
> ,and then restructuring the predicted values with the `PassengerIds` as a *DataFrame* and storing them in a `.csv` file for submission.
>
> This was just trying out some ML intoduction stuffs.

### Day 2

> Just a practice notebook for Python3, testing out assignment operators, arithmetic operators, and performing basic arithmetic problems using Python3 to get a grasp of the language.

### Day 3

> Advancing from the previous notebook, here I get to use some predefined and also custom functions and perform arithmetic operations but using functions and nested functions.

### Day 4

> All about the Boolean data type, which allows you to represent “`True`” and “`False`” in Python code. This will provide a strong foundation for understanding how to write conditional statements, which are used to modify how code runs based on whether certain conditions hold.

### Day 5

> Python lists to store ordered collections of values. Lists are incredibly useful when writing code to manage several related variables.
>
> Efficient way to repeatedly execute code. With list comprehensions, you'll often be able to condense code that would have taken several lines to just a single line!

### Day 6

> Strings, which is a data type that is useful for representing human-readable data, such as text. A dictionary is another new data type, that is similar to a list, but with important differences that makes it incredibly useful in its own right.

### Day 7

> One of the best things about Python is the vast number of high-quality custom libraries that have been written for it. Here, you can try out various other pre-written functions to use during various computation, like in this *[.ipnyb](Day-7\exercise-working-with-external-libraries.ipynb)* file.

### Day 8

> You will start at the very beginning: what exactly is “Machine Learning”, and how is it used in the real world? You'll learn the answers to these questions and explore the basics of decision trees, as you start to build a strong foundation for some of the most cutting-edge techniques in data science.
>
> All about pandas, the primary tool used by data scientists for exploring and manipulating data. Then, you'll use your new knowledge to examine a dataset of home prices.

### Day 9
