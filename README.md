# 30-Days-of-ML-Kaggle

### Day 1

> Reading data from `.csv` files using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) *Dataframes*, finding % of women who survived the Titanic and then using [RandomForestClassifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest), making a model to predict the survival of the female passengers using features like
>
> ```python
> features = ["Pclass", "Sex", "SibSp", "Parch"]
> ```
>
> ,and then restructuring the predicted values with the `PassengerIds` as a *DataFrame* and storing them in a `.csv` file for submission.
>
> This was just trying out some ML intoduction stuffs.

### Day 2

> Just a practice notebook for Python3, testing out assignment operators, arithmetic operators, and performing basic arithmetic problems using Python3 to get a grasp of the language.

### Day 3

> Advancing from the previous notebook, here I get to use some predefined and also custom functions and perform arithmetic operations but using functions and nested functions.

### Day 4

> All about the Boolean data type, which allows you to represent “`True`” and “`False`” in Python code. This will provide a strong foundation for understanding how to write conditional statements, which are used to modify how code runs based on whether certain conditions hold.

### Day 5

> Python lists to store ordered collections of values. Lists are incredibly useful when writing code to manage several related variables.
>
> Efficient way to repeatedly execute code. With list comprehensions, you'll often be able to condense code that would have taken several lines to just a single line!

### Day 6

> Strings, which is a data type that is useful for representing human-readable data, such as text. A dictionary is another new data type, that is similar to a list, but with important differences that makes it incredibly useful in its own right.

### Day 7
