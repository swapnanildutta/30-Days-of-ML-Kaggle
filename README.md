# 30-Days-of-ML-Kaggle

### Day 1

> Reading data from `.csv` files using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) *Dataframes*, finding % of women who survived the Titanic and then using [RandomForestClassifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest), making a model to predict the survival of the female passengers using features like
>
> ```python
> features = ["Pclass", "Sex", "SibSp", "Parch"]
> ```
>
> ,and then restructuring the predicted values with the `PassengerIds` as a *DataFrame* and storing them in a `.csv` file for submission.

### Day 2

> Just a practice notebook for Python3, testing out assignment operators, arithmetic operators, and performing basic arithmetic problems using Python3 to get a grasp of the language.

### Day 3

> Advancing from the previous notebook, here I get to use some predefined and also custom functions and perform arithmetic operations but using functions and nested functions.

### Day 4
