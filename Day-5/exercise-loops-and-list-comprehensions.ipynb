Don't worry, we'll send you the bill later.\n\nOn average, how much money can you expect to gain (or lose) every time you play the machine?  The casino keeps it a secret, but you can estimate the average value of each pull using a technique called the **Monte Carlo method**. To estimate the average outcome, we simulate the scenario many times, and return the average result.\n\nComplete the following function to calculate the average value per play of the slot machine.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def estimate_average_slot_payout(n_runs):\n    \"\"\"Run the slot machine n_runs times and return the average net profit per run.\n    Example calls (note that return value is nondeterministic!):\n    >>> estimate_average_slot_payout(1)\n    -1\n    >>> estimate_average_slot_payout(1)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\"\n    profit=0\n    for i in range(n_runs):\n        profit-=1\n        profit+=play_slot_machine()\n    profit=profit/n_runs\n    print(profit)\nestimate_average_slot_payout(500000)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-07T15:28:34.012450Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-07T15:28:34.012818Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-07T15:28:34.273117Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-07T15:28:34.012784Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-07T15:28:34.272113Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":89,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"0.026097\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When you think you know the expected value per spin, run the code cell below to view the solution and get credit for answering the question.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)\nq4.solution()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-07T15:28:40.965955Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-07T15:28:40.966510Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-07T15:28:40.974851Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-07T15:28:40.966466Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-07T15:28:40.973913Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":90,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>","application/javascript":"parent.postMessage({\"jupyterEvent\": \"custom.exercise_interaction\", \"data\": {\"interactionType\": 3, \"questionType\": 4, \"questionId\": \"4_ExpectedSlotsPayout\", \"learnToolsVersion\": \"0.3.4\", \"valueTowardsCompletion\": 0.0, \"failureMessage\": \"\", \"exceptionClass\": \"\", \"trace\": \"\", \"outcomeType\": 4}}, \"*\")"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Solution: The exact expected value of one pull of the slot machine is 0.025 - i.e. a little more than 2 cents.
